Pure python datalog compiler and optimization framework


Compiles to pseudocode, C, and a python RA library called pyra

Performs rule-based algebraic optimization.  (Not cost-based yet.)

To add a new language, you define your physical operators and define optimization rules mapping
your logical operators to these physical operators.  They need not be 1:1.


Inspect and run

$ python helloworld.py
